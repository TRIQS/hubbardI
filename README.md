# hubbardI - A Hubbard-I solver based on triqs atom_diag

This application implements the Hubbard-I solver in triqs using the lightweight diagonalization routine which come with triqs/atom_diag.

Requires a working TRIQS instalation with a matching major version number.

### Usage ###
The Solver comes with the same interface as, e.g., the [cthyb solver](https://triqs.github.io/cthyb/latest/index.html). More information on how to use the solver can be found in the [documentation](https://triqs.github.io/hubbardI/latest/documentation.html).
