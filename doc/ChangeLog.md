We thank all contributors: Thomas Hahn, Alexander Hampel, Dylan Simon, Nils Wentzell

Find below an itemized list of changes in this release.

### General
* Rename U_matrix to U_matrix_slater
* add print of Hloc upon solve


## Version 3.1.0

hubbardI version 3.1.0 is a compatibility
release for TRIQS version 3.1.0 that
* uses the latest [app4triqs/3.1.x](https://github.com/TRIQS/app4triqs) skeleton
* switches documentation to read-the-docs theme
* improves ghactions and jenkins configuration

We thank all contributors: Alexander Hampel, Dylan Simon, Nils Wentzell


## Version 3.0.0

hubbardI version 3.0.0 is a compatibility
release for TRIQS version 3.0.0 that
* introduces compatibility with Python 3 (Python 2 no longer supported)
* adds a cmake-based dependency management


## Version 2.2

This is a complete rewrite which is compatible to triqs 2.2. For solving the atomic problem the atom_diag function of triqs is used. The solve function now works completely similar to the cthyb solve function which ensures exchangeability between both solvers.

If you are moving from 1.4 to 2.2 this might help: The parts of a script in version 1.4

 .. code-block:: python

	from pytriqs.applications.impurity_solvers.hubbard_I.hubbard_solver import Solver

	# Init the Hubbard-I solver:
	S = Solver( beta, l )

	# set the atomic levels explicitly by matrix eal
	S.set_atomic_levels( eal )

	# solve and specify the interaction via U and J parameters
	S.solve( U_int, J_hund )

transitions to the following in version 2.2
 .. code-block:: python

	from triqs_hubbardI import *

	# Init the Hubbard-I solver:
	S = Solver( beta, gf_struct )

	# set the interaction via an interaction Hamiltonian
	U_sph = U_matrix( l, U_int, J_hund )
	U_cubic = transform_U_matrix( U_sph, spherical_to_cubic(l, convention='') )
	H = h_int_slater( spin_names, orb_names, U_cubic, map_operator_structure )

	# set the non-interacting Green's function
	S.G0_iw << inverse( S.Sigma_iw + inverse( S.G_iw ) )

	# Solve the impurity problem specifying the interaction Hamiltonian
	# the atomic levels are automatically set by the high frequency behavior of S.G0_iw
	S.solve( h_int = H )


We can see two main changes:
	* The interaction in version 1.4 is given in terms of ``U_int`` and ``J_hund`` while it is given in terms of an arbitrary interaction Hamiltonian (:ref:`triqs operator object <triqslibs:operators>`) in version 2.2.
	* The atomic levels are set explicitly via ``eal`` in version 1.4 while they are extracted automatically from the non-interacting Green's function ``S.G0_iw`` in version 2.2.

For a more detailed comparison compare the Ce example in the tutorial section of the dft_tools app and the Ce example in the example section here: :ref:`ce`

## Version 1.4

This version is only compatible to triqs 1.4. It comes with a fortran solver for the atomic problem.
